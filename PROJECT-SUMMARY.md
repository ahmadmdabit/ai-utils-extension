## 1. Final Feature Set

This section details all user-facing features implemented in the final version of the extension.

#### Core AI Capabilities (Pipelines)
The extension's primary feature is a selection of multi-step processing pipelines that execute sequential operations on tab content:
- **Summarize:** Generates a concise summary of a webpage.
- **Translate:** Translates webpage content into a user-selected language.
- **Scrape Data:** Extracts specific information from a webpage (see below).
- **Translated Summary:** A two-step pipeline that first summarizes a page and then translates the summary.
- **Dual-Language Summary:** A three-step pipeline that generates a summary, translates it, and then presents both versions side-by-side.

#### Advanced Data Scraping
When the "Scrape Data" pipeline is selected, users can choose from several methods:
- **Helpful Info (AI):** A general-purpose extraction powered by a Gemini prompt.
- **Headings:** A fast, deterministic extraction of all `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>` tags.
- **Links:** Extracts all hyperlinks with their text and URLs.
- **Tabular Data:** Parses and extracts content from HTML `<table>` elements.
- **LinkedIn Jobs Parser:** A specialized scraper that extracts job details from LinkedIn search pages and can generate interactive HTML reports with client-side filtering and sorting capabilities.
- **LinkedIn Job Filter:** A powerful client-side filtering system that enhances LinkedIn job search pages with real-time filtering, draggable UI, and user-controlled activation.
- **Custom Prompt (AI):** Allows the user to provide a custom prompt for targeted data extraction.

#### User Configuration & Experience
- **Spotify-Inspired UI:** A modern, dark-themed interface designed for clarity and aesthetic appeal, implemented with Tailwind CSS v4's `@theme` directive.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** The UI provides live status updates for each task (`Pending`, `Processing`, `Complete`, `Error`) and displays a final, AI-generated title for combined results.
- **Gemini Model Selection:** Users can choose between different Gemini models (`2.5 Pro`, `2.5 Flash`, `2.5 Flash-Lite`) to balance performance, cost, and capability.
- **Language Selection:** A dedicated UI for selecting a target translation language, with presets and a custom input option.
- **Secure API Key Management:** A settings page allows users to securely save their Gemini API key to `chrome.storage.local`.
- **Combine Tabs Results:** A powerful option to synthesize the results from multiple selected tabs into a single, cohesive output. The system processes all selected tabs at each step of a pipeline before combining them, enabling complex, multi-stage analysis.
- **Process Cancellation:** Users can cancel long-running processes with the Cancel button.
- **Configurable Timeouts:** Users can set processing timeouts in the Settings panel to prevent indefinite processing.
- **Tab Refresh:** Users can refresh the tab list with the reload button to see their latest open tabs.
- **Output Format Selection:** For LinkedIn job scraping, users can choose between JSON and interactive HTML output formats.
- **LinkedIn Job Filter:** A comprehensive client-side filtering system with user-controlled activation, real-time search, status filtering, draggable UI, and position persistence.

## 2. Architectural Overview

The extension is built on a clean, decoupled architecture separating the user interface from the background processing logic.

#### Frontend (Sidepanel)
- **Framework:** Built with **React 19** and bootstrapped with **Vite** for a fast development experience and optimized production builds.
- **Component Design:** Follows an **Atomic Design** philosophy, with simple, reusable "atom" components (`Button`, `Checkbox`, `Counter`) composed into more complex "molecule" and "feature" components.
- **State Management:** Utilizes React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`). All critical application state is "lifted up" and managed within the main `App.tsx` component, which passes state and callbacks down to controlled child components.

#### Backend (Service Worker)
- **Core Logic:** The service worker acts as the "brain" of the extension. It is architected as a **"Step-First" Workflow Engine**.
- **Workflow:**
  1.  The UI sends a `START_PROCESSING` message with the user's complete configuration (tabs, pipeline, model, combine flag, etc.).
  2.  The service worker's `runWorkflow` function takes control.
  3.  It loops through the **steps** of the selected pipeline (e.g., 1. Summarize, 2. Translate).
  4.  For each step, it processes all selected tabs (either in parallel for local operations or sequentially for API calls).
  5.  If "Combine Tabs" is enabled, it performs a final synthesis step after a pipeline step is complete for all tabs.
  6.  The output of each step is stored and used as the input for the next, enabling complex, dependent "Matrix" combinations.
- **Cancellation & Timeout Support:** The service worker now supports process cancellation via AbortController and configurable timeouts.

#### Communication Layer
- A strongly-typed messaging system (defined in `src/types/messaging.ts`) is used for all communication between the sidepanel UI and the service worker.
- The LinkedIn filtering system uses the same messaging infrastructure for toggle control, state queries, and UI management between the sidepanel and content script.

## 3. Key Technical Implementations

- **`geminiService.ts`:** A dedicated, isolated service responsible for all communication with the Google Gemini API. It handles dynamic URL construction (based on the selected model), prompt generation (including synthesis and title generation), and API error handling. Now supports cancellation via AbortSignal.
- **`pipelines.ts`:** A declarative, data-driven definition of all available processing pipelines. This makes the workflow engine flexible and easy to extend.
- **`scrapers.ts`:** A collection of self-contained, pure functions designed to be injected into web pages with `chrome.scripting.executeScript` for fast, deterministic DOM scraping.
- **`renderer.ts`:** Generates interactive HTML reports for LinkedIn job scraping with client-side filtering and sorting capabilities.
- **`linkedin-filter-content.ts`:** Main entry point for LinkedIn job filtering content script with message handling and lifecycle management.
- **`linkedin-filter.ts`:** Core LinkedInJobFilter class with comprehensive state management and initialization logic.
- **`linkedin-filter-ui.ts`:** Creates and manages the draggable filter UI with position persistence and event handling.
- **`linkedin-filter-engine.ts`:** Performance-optimized filtering logic with CSS-based job hiding.
- **`linkedin-job-parser.ts`:** Parses and validates job data from LinkedIn DOM elements.
- **`constants.ts`:** Centralized configuration constants for selectors, URLs, and styling.
- **`linkedin-filter.css`:** Professional styling that matches LinkedIn's design language with CSS variables.
- **`linkedin-filter.ts`:** TypeScript interfaces for job elements, filter criteria, and UI state.
- **Conditional UI Components:** The UI is composed of several feature components (`PipelineSelector`, `ActionOptions`, `DataScrapeOptions`, `LanguageSelector`, `OutputFormatSelector`) that are conditionally rendered based on the application's state.
- **Cancellation Support:** The UI now includes a Cancel button that sends a `CANCEL_PROCESSING` message to the service worker.

## 4. Development Standards & Developer Experience

The project was built with a strong emphasis on quality, consistency, and maintainability.

#### Git & Version Control
- **Workflow:** Follows the **GitFlow** model (`main`, `develop`, `feature/*` branches).
- **Commits:** Adheres to the **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** specification.

#### Code Quality & Automation
- **Linting & Formatting:** **ESLint** (with Flat Config) and **Prettier** are used to enforce a consistent coding style.
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** **Husky** and **lint-staged** are configured to automatically lint and format all staged files before every commit.

#### Testing Strategy
- **Frameworks:** **Vitest** is used as the test runner, with native React DOM testing utilities for component testing.
- **Coverage:** The project maintains a high level of test coverage, ensuring all critical logic is validated (92.67% statements across 135 tests in 23 files).
- **Mocking:** The `chrome` global API is mocked using a manual, type-safe mock defined in `src/setupTests.ts`. This was a key architectural decision that enables robust, isolated unit tests.
- **Cancellation Testing:** Added tests for cancellation and timeout functionality in the service worker.
- **Test Utilities:** Custom `src/test-utils.ts` provides consistent rendering, event handling, and cleanup across all tests.
