  - **Translated Summary**: Summarize a page and then translate the summary into your chosen language.
  - **Dual-Language Summary**: Get a summary in both its original language and a translated version.
- **Advanced Data Scrape**: Extract specific information from pages using a variety of methods:
  - **Helpful Info (AI)**: Let Gemini find the most relevant information.

## üìú Development Conventions

This project adheres to a strict set of conventions to ensure code quality, consistency, and maintainability.

### Software Design Principles
- **SOLID**: Components and services are designed with the Single Responsibility Principle in mind.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: We aim for the simplest effective solution.
- **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)**: We avoid implementing features until they are actually required.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Logic is abstracted into reusable hooks, services, and components.

### üìÅ Directory Structure
The project uses a feature-sliced, atomic design-inspired structure to keep the codebase organized and scalable.

```
/src
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/          # Static assets like icons
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ background/      # Service worker and related logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/      # Reusable, "dumb" UI components (Atoms, Molecules)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/        # "Smart" components that compose smaller components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/        # API clients and Chrome API wrappers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/          # Global styles (index.css)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/           # TypeScript type definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/           # Helper functions
```

### Git Workflow
- **Branching Model**: We follow the **GitFlow** model.
  - `main`: Contains production-ready, tagged releases.
  - `develop`: The primary development branch. All feature branches are merged here.
  - `feature/*`: Branches for new features.
- **Pull Requests**: All code must be reviewed via a Pull Request before being merged into `develop`.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Commit Messages
- We follow the **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** specification. This allows for automated changelog generation and a clear, readable commit history.

### üé® Coding Style
- **Formatting**: Enforced by **Prettier**.
- **Linting**: Enforced by **ESLint** with strict rules for TypeScript and React.
- **Automation**: **Husky** and **lint-staged** are configured to automatically lint and format all staged files on every `git commit`.

### ‚úÖ Testing
- **Frameworks**: **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)** for test running and **[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)** for component testing.
- **Coverage**: The project maintains a high level of test coverage across all components and services.
- **Mocks**: The `chrome` API and other external dependencies are mocked using Vitest's global mocks (`src/setupTests.ts`) to ensure reliable and fast unit tests.
